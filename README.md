### EC526 Final Project Edge Detection with Canny algorithm
- Canny edge detection is a technique to **extract useful structural information** from different vision objects and dramatically reduce the amount of data to be processed. It has been widely applied in various computer vision systems.

### The general criteria for edge detection include: 
- Detection of edge with low error rate, which means that the detection should accurately catch as many edges shown in the image as possible. 
- The edge point detected from the operator should accurately localize on the center of the edge.
- A given edge in the image should only be marked once, and where possible, image noise should not create false edges. To satisfy these requirements Canny used the calculus of variations â€“ a technique which finds the function which optimizes a given functional.

### Environment:
- OpenCV

- C++ 11

- OpenMP
